# Battle of Emerging Rock Bands 2025 (UK)
This is where guitars wail, amps crackle and drummers hit harder than your morning coffee. It’s not just a competition – it’s a **rock ‘n roll battlefield** where the loudest, most electrifying, emerging rock bands fight for glory.

But here’s the twist: **the battle is online**. No sweaty crowds, just you deciding the fate of 2025’s hottest up and coming talent from the comfort of your screen.

When you hit **GO!**, on the Battle Page, you summon **4 bands selected at random** from our arsenal of all the bands playing at independent festivals this year.

They will clash, packed with riffs and hooks to shake your speakers and get your neighbours to file for a noise complaint!

**Vote for THE 1 band** who deserves the ultimate bragging rights.

Who can play as many times as you like. Just hit GO! again, after you have voted, and keep discovering new music!

## 7. Bugs Resolved and Unresolved
Possibly, the greatest 'bug' was my own imposter-syndrom. Having completed the course material I was left feeling like there were elements in the course that I did not understand, leaving large gaps in my learning. Following a conversation with my mentor, he suggested that the only way to learn was to tackle the subject matter 'head-on' and just keep practicing. 

Although, this was extremely good advice I still struggled with self-doubt throughtout this project. In order to over-come this enough to complete the project I joined the Slack 'Imposter Syndrome' group. Even though I didn't contribute much due to feeling like an imposter in the group, it was encouraging to see others struggling and their coping techniques and mechanisms. The greatest piece of advice came from a newsletter I subscribe to by Sahil Bloom, where he adopted a technique given to him by a friend of his to have a 'Coaching Session' With yourself by emailing yourself and then giving yourself advise. This I practised sporadically until it became inbedded into my daily routine.
