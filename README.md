# Battle of Emerging Rock Bands 2025 (UK)

This is where guitars wail, amps crackle and drummers hit harder than your morning coffee. It’s not just a competition – it’s a **rock ‘n roll battlefield** where the loudest, most electrifying, emerging rock bands fight for glory.

## 1. Introduction

The Battle of Emerging Rock Bands 2025 (UK) website has been designed to allow users the opportunity of discovering new bands and their music, in a fun and interactive way. By using a voting system, users are encouraged to watch 4 bands before they can either run the programme again or go and find more music by the bands they have just watched and listened to.

## 2. Aim and Purpose of the site

The aim and purpose of this website is to expose users to music that they may not have heard before as well as provide an opportunity to interact with the website. Up until now (before the launch of this website) fans would simply go to the different Independent Festival websites, based in the UK for 2025, to see the line-up. Although these websites are informative, they are often just a list of bands and artists that mean the user would need to go and do their own research before the festival. 

By engaging with this website, users will come across bands and artists that they have not heard of. The whole point of the Independent Emerging Rock and Metal Festivals is to showcase up-and-coming new talent. Therefore, this website serves to add value to the genre by offering a fun and engaging way to discover new music.

## 3. Target Audience

The target Audience for this website are fellow rock and metal heads and fans. More specifically people who enjoy going to independant rock and metal festivals, based in Great Britain, that showcase emerging British bands and artists.

## 5. Goals

To create a website that is visually appealing, enjoyable to engage with, light-hearted and simple to use so as not to detract from the aim and objective of the website: to discover new music.

## 6. Planning and Development

The idea came about during my initial meeting with my Mentor, Richard Wells, when discussing the type of interactivity, I found lacking within my favourite musical taste and the type of interactivity I would enjoy using as I am not a game player.

### 6.1 Wire Frames

### 6.2 Colour Pallet

The colour palette chosen is the typical colour scheme of the rock and metal scene: red , white and black. However, I change the 'white' for a softer shade of light grey that isn't so stark on the eyes and doesn't cause blurring and bleeding into the black or red. The colours chosen were:

I found the colour using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website.

I also included the dark grey for the Navbar to make it stand out against the black background with just enough contrast so that it stood out just enough without making it a stand-out feature, as the navigation of the website is quite self-explanatory.

### 6.3 Typography

For ease and simplicity I chose Geist Mono with a monospaced appearance, throughout, for the typography as found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). AS the designer I prefer this text for its simplicity and "old school" typewritter style effect, it is easy to read and nostalgic quality:

Please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and Debugging *markdown* file.

## 9. Deployment
 
 Deployment was done early following on from lessons and guidance in a Code Institute Software Development course. At the time of writing there had been **146** deployments.

## 10. Future Features

As this website was developed solely as a project for my Full Stack Developer's course at the *Code Institute* the number of bans entered into the bandData array only totals 44 and is not a list of all the bands touring independent festivals in 2025. This was due to the lack of time needed to be able to do the necessary research to find and list each band or artist with a video for each. 

As previously mentioned under the **Informal manual (live) testing** section in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) document, not all muscians allow for their music to be embeded outside of Youtube. This alone takes a lot of sorting time in finding music videos for the website. A possible future development could include a testing function that checks if a band allows their music embeded on different platforms before entering the bandData into the array.

Further, this website could very easily include bandData elements with the festival names that the individual bands and artists are playing at, in the Battle Cards. 

Furthermore, additional functionality could also be added to include the ability for the user to select whether they wanted 4 randomly selected bands (as it currently is), or bands only playing at one festival, or a selection of (2 or more) festivals, if the festival data was included.

The only constraint for the above to be included was time, as previously alluded.
