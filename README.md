# Battle of Emerging Rock Bands 2025 (UK)

This is where guitars wail, amps crackle and drummers hit harder than your morning coffee. It’s not just a competition – it’s a **rock ‘n roll battlefield** where the loudest, most electrifying, emerging rock bands fight for glory.

## 1. Introduction

The Battle of Emerging Rock Bands 2025 (UK) website has been designed to allow users the opportunity of discovering new bands and their music, in a fun and interactive way. By using a voting system, users are encouraged to watch 4 bands before they can either run the programme again or go and find more music by the bands they have just watched and listened to.

## 2. Aim and Purpose of the site

The aim and purpose of this website is to expose users to music that they may not have heard before as well as provide an opportunity to interact with the website. Up until now (before the launch of this website) fans would simply go to the different Independent Festival websites, based in the UK for 2025, to see the line-up. Although these websites are informative, they are often just a list of bands and artists that mean the user would need to go and do their own research before the festival. 

By engaging with this website, users will come across bands and artists that they have not heard of. The whole point of the Independent Emerging Rock and Metal Festivals is to showcase up-and-coming new talent. Therefore, this website serves to add value to the genre by offering a fun and engaging way to discover new music.

## 3. Target Audience

The target Audience for this website are fellow rock and metal heads and fans. More specifically people who enjoy going to independant rock and metal festivals, based in Great Britain, that showcase emerging British bands and artists.

## 4. User's Stories

- As a user I want to discover new music (must-have)
- As a user I want to be entertained (must-have)
- As a user I want to have fun while discovering new music (must-Have)
- As a user I want to do all this simply and without additional and unnecessary navigation (must-have)
- As a user I want to have a positive emotional experience (should-have)
- As a user I want to be able to find out which festivals the different bands are playing at (could-have)
- As a user I want to be able to select only the bands that are playing at a particular festival (could-have)

## 5. Goals

To create a website that is visually appealing, enjoyable to engage with, light-hearted and simple to use so as not to detract from the aim and objective of the website: to discover new music. But most of all, to be entertaining.

## 6. Planning and Development

The idea came about during my initial meeting with my Mentor, Richard Wells, when discussing the type of interactivity, I found lacking within my favourite musical taste and the type of interactivity I would enjoy using, as I am not a game player.

### 6.1 Wire Frames

I decided to build the website from a mobile with a width of 320px so that I would only need to scale up for responsiveness. This resulted in fewer media query scaling and styling elements and meant that I only had to focus on styles once without the complexity of issues I had in project one.

I played around a lot with the initial wireframe to try and design the website to make it as appealing as possible with the end user in mind. I continued to adapt the wireframe as I went along and settled on this one:

#### 6.1.1 Mobile Wireframe

![mobile wireframe](assets/imgs/documentation/mobile-wireframe.png)
#### 6.1.2 Large Screen Wireframe

For the large and extra large screens I want the battle page on one screen without having to scroll up and down to participate. This decision to focus on the larger screen was to limit the size of the different elements and also set the maximum width to 1200px.

### 6.2 Colour Palette

The colour palette chosen is the typical colour scheme of the rock and metal scene: red , white and black. However, I change the 'white' for a softer shade of light grey that isn't so stark on the eyes and doesn't cause blurring and bleeding into the black or red. The colours chosen were:

![colour-palette](assets/imgs/documentation/colour-palett.png)

I found the colour using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website.

I also included the dark grey for the Navbar to make it stand out against the black background with just enough contrast so that it stood out without making it a feature, as the navigation of the website is quite self-explanatory.

### 6.3 Typography

For ease and simplicity I chose Geist Mono with a monospaced appearance, throughout, for the typography as found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). AS the designer I prefer this text for its simplicity and "old school" typewritter style effect, it is easy to read and nostalgic quality:

## 8. Testing and Debugging

Please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and Debugging *markdown* file.

## 9. Deployment
 
 Deployment was done early following on from lessons and guidance in a Code Institute Software Development course in order to see what the website looks like as I coded along. At the time of writing there had been **156** deployments.

 The site was deployed to *GitHub* Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. In the *GitHub* repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch, then click "Save"
3. The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
The live link can be found [here](https://github.com/AxdeKlerk/BotB-25/settings/pages)

### 9.1 Local Deployment
This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

#### 9.1.1 Cloning
You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the *GitHub* [repository](https://github.com/AxdeKlerk/BotB-25)
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or *GitHub* CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
git clone https://github.com/AxdeKlerk/BotB-25.git
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository onto your own local workspace.

Please note that in order to open the project in VS Code (or any other local editor), you may have to instal the programme if not already installed on your pc or laptop. A tutorial on how to clone a Git repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

#### 9.1.2 Forking
By forking the *GitHub* Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our *GitHub* account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to *GitHub* and locate the *GitHub* Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own *GitHub* account!

## 10. Future Features

As this website was developed solely as a project for my Full Stack Developer's course at the *Code Institute* the number of bans entered into the bandData array only totals 44 and is not a list of all the bands touring independent festivals in 2025. This was due to the lack of time needed to be able to do the necessary research to find and list each band or artist with a video for each. 

As previously mentioned under the **Informal manual (live) testing** section in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) document, not all muscians allow for their music to be embeded outside of Youtube. This alone takes a lot of sorting time in finding music videos for the website. A possible future development could include a testing function that checks if a band allows their music embeded on different platforms before entering the bandData into the array.

Further, this website could very easily include bandData elements with the festival names that the individual bands and artists are playing at, in the Battle Cards. 

Furthermore, additional functionality could also be added to include the ability for the user to select whether they wanted 4 randomly selected bands (as it currently is), or bands only playing at one festival, or a selection of (2 or more) festivals, if the festival data was included.

The only constraint for the above to be included was time, as previously alluded.
